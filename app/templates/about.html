            <h2>Opening</h2>
            <p>
                As a self-taught developer breaking into tech, I know firsthand how
                overwhelming it can be to figure out which skills employers actually
                want. That's why I built this tool - to help job seekers cut through
                the noise and focus their learning on what's truly in demand in their
                local market.

            <h2>My transition story</h2>
            <p>
                After discovering that programming perfectly blends my love for both
                creative problem-solving and technology, I dove into self-directed
                learning through resources like FreeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, and
                ultimately Harvard's CS50 intro to computer science course.

            <h2>Technical approach and skills</h2>
            <p>
                I chose Flask for its flexibility, integrated Selenium for
                reliable web scraping, and used Google Charts to make the data
                actionable and visually clear

            <h2>What sets me apart</h2>
            <p>
                I noticed a gap between generic job advice and actual local
                market demands
