                As a self-taught developer breaking into tech, I know firsthand how
                time-consuming it can be to figure out which skills employers actually
                want. That's why I built this tool - to help job seekers cut through
                the noise and focus their learning on what's truly in demand in their
                local market.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                After discovering that programming perfectly blends my love for
                creativity and technology, I dove into self-directed learning
                through resources like FreeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, and
                ultimately Harvard's CS50 intro to computer science course. This
                empowered me to utilize these skills and interests to create an
                app that actually solves a real problem I had as a job seeker and
                early-career learner.
            </p>
            <p>
                I approached learning programming strategically by reverse-engineering
                job requirements to focus my efforts efficiently. Recognizing the
                gap between generic career advice and actual local market demands,
                I built a tool that provides concrete, actionable information. As a
                self-taught developer, I excel at finding resources and staying
                motivated to solve real problems.

                When planning this project, I chose Python/Flask for its flexibility,
                Selenium for robust web scraping, Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) for
                its open-source reverse-geocoding capabilities, Google Charts
                for clear data visualization, and Bootstrap and vanilla JavaScript to
                create a clean and responsive interface. This project let me
                develop skills across front-end visualization and interactivity,
                to back-end data processing, and API integration.
            </p>
            <p>
                I approach problems methodically. When building the scraping
                functionality, I carefully analyzed the site's structure and
                implemented robust error handling to ensure reliable data
                extraction. I naturally focus on understanding why solutions work,
                not just implementing them, which helps me write more maintainable
                code.
